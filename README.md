Welcome to the repo for Project Mousie, a hands-free computer mouse designed for people with hand tremors (e.g., PD-associated, benign essential tremors, etc.).

This is the cleaned-up final repo for Project Mousie. To see the full evolution of the project, please see my [`makeable repo`](https://github.com/jadoratan/makeable).
Warning: the makeable repo contains files used for research and testing purposes that do not appear in the [`project-mousie`](https://github.com/jadoratan/project-mousie) repository.

Special thanks to...
üñ±Ô∏è My goated EDD/Senior Project teammates, Leo (electrical) and Chris (CAD), for being so patient and hardworking
üñ±Ô∏è Lulu and her family, for being so willing to test our designs and share Lulu's story
