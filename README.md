Welcome to the repository for Project Mousie, a hands-free computer mouse designed for people with hand tremors (e.g., PD-associated tremors, benign essential tremors, etc.).


This is the cleaned-up final repo for Project Mousie. To see the full evolution of the project, please see my [`makeable`](https://github.com/jadoratan/makeable) repo.
Warning: the [`makeable`](https://github.com/jadoratan/makeable) repo contains files used for research and testing purposes that do not appear in the [`project-mousie`](https://github.com/jadoratan/project-mousie) repo.


Special thanks to...
